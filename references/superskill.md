# YieldAgent Superskills

*Modular add-on: advanced capabilities that emerge when YieldAgent combines with agent memory and scheduling.*

> Not investment advice. Superskills are tools for monitoring and managing yield positions. The agent reports data and builds transactions. You make decisions.

## How Superskills Work

Superskills combine three capabilities:

```
┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
│  Yield.xyz API  │ + │  Agent State    │ + │   Scheduling    │
│                 │   │                 │   │                 │
│ • Real-time     │   │ • Positions     │   │ • Heartbeats    │
│   yield data    │   │ • Rate history  │   │ • Cron jobs     │
│ • Balances      │   │ • Preferences   │   │ • Periodic      │

```

**State File:** `~/.openclaw/skills/yield-agent/state/yield-cache.json`

Single JSON file. Positions keyed by yieldId for O(1) lookup. Rate history capped at 30 days to prevent bloat. Preferences are global defaults with per-position overrides.

**Schema notes:**
- `positions[].status`: `active`, `pending_exit`, `deprecated`, `paused`
- `positions[].exitAvailableAt`: set when unstaking cooldown applies
- `positions[].alertThreshold`: per-position override of `preferences.defaults.alertOnDropPercent`
- `rateHistory`: capped at `preferences.defaults.rateHistoryDays` entries per position
- `wallets`: tracks addresses for multi-wallet superskills
- `meta.lastHeartbeat`: used by scheduling superskills to know when checks last ran

## Examples

### Rate Monitoring

User: "Alert me if my Aave yield drops below 3%"

```bash
# 1. Add alert to state file (~/.openclaw/skills/yield-agent/state/yield-cache.json)
#    alerts.rateAlerts += { yieldId, condition: "below", threshold: 0.03, active: true }

# 2. On each heartbeat check:
YIELD=$(./scripts/get-yield-info.sh base-usdc-aave-v3-lending)
CURRENT_RATE=$(echo "$YIELD" | jq '.rewardRate.total')

# 3. Compare against stored threshold, alert if breached
# 4. Update positions[].lastRate and positions[].lastChecked
```

Agent: "Watching base-usdc-aave-v3-lending. Currently at 4.1%. I'll ping you if it drops below 3%."

### Morning Briefing

Agent (8:02 AM):

```
Morning. Here's your yield summary:

Positions:
  Aave Base USDC — 4.1% (stable)
  Morpho Flagship — 5.7% (+0.3% from yesterday)
  Compound — 3.1% (was 3.8%, dropped 3 days in a row)

Alerts:
• Compound is below your 3.5% threshold
• $89 in rewards ready to claim across 3 positions

Recommendations:
• Compound is underperforming — want alternatives?
```

### Rotation Workflow

User: "Move me out of anything under 3.5%"

Agent:

```
Scanning 4 positions...

Found 1 below threshold:
• Compound ETH — 3.1% (threshold: 3.5%)

Best replacement for ETH:
• Lido — 4.8%

Rotation plan:
1. Exit Compound (withdraw 2.5 ETH)
2. Enter Lido (stake 2.5 ETH)

2 transactions. Want to proceed?
```

## What Superskills Are NOT

- Not investment advice — agent reports numbers, you decide
- Not automated trading — every transaction needs your approval
- Not predictions — no forecasting, no "this will go up"
- Not risk ratings — TVL and audit status are facts, not recommendations
- Not guaranteed — rates change, protocols have risks
